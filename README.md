### Hey guys - please feel free to look areound ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects to build up my portfolio as a web developer! 
   A few month ago I decided to dive deep into frontend web technologies like HTML and CSS. After a few weeks in, I decided to add
   some JS to actually make my sites and Apps do something. Recently I stumbled across a YT Channel which teaches programming with real-world projects.
   That's why you find clones of some of the most known apps of the internet in my repos. 
   
   It's fun to build something and see it grow line by line. I plan get a job as a freelance developer this year, so that I can make a side income additionally to  
   my main income and live life to the fullest. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS. Also I'm regularly getting better with HTML and CSS, too. I chose React because it's pretty powerful JS library. You can build      massive projects with very little effort. At least from my point of view. ;) 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with some quirky concepts in ReactJS like context or StateProviders. These topics are something I cannot quite wrap my head around until        now. So anybody who has some helpful sources for learning is welcomed to share them with me. :) 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anythinf you want. I cannot promise that I'll always have an answer but I'll make damn sure that I'll find it in a short amount of time.

âš¡ Fun fact: Everything you need to grow is already inside you - you just have to find it. :)
